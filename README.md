# RWD Viewer

## Purpose
I needed a simple way to view the same page at multiple media queries as I was developing a responsive website.

I wrote this simple viewer which shows the page at three prefefined widths by default. Works best on a cinema display, and I recommend using LiveReload.


## Usage

Open in your browser of choice with your page to test (local or remote) specified as the page URL parameter, e.g.

	rwdviewer/index.html?page=http://elevatorup.com/

## Example
	
<img src="readme/screenshot.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">
*Also pretty sweet for taking screenshots of multiple media queries*
